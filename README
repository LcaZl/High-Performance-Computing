# High-Performance Computing: Hough Transform for Line Detection

This project investigates parallel implementations of the Hough Transform (HT) for line detection in images. The work focuses on leveraging High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques to optimize three variants of the HT algorithm:

- Standard Hough Transform (HT)
- Probabilistic Hough Transform (PHT)
- Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform (PPHT)

Each algorithm is implemented in multiple forms: sequential, MPI-parallelized, OpenMP-parallelized, and a hybrid MPI/OpenMP version. The project is developed in C++ for core logic and in Python for dataset generation, image processing, and performance analysis.

The aim is to evaluate the computational performance and scalability of different parallel strategies using synthetic and natural image datasets.

For a complete description of the project and results refere to the [report](Report.pdf)

# Folders Organization

- "dataset" folder: 
    - "random_images" folder contains single natural images for testing
    - "synthetic_images" folder contains images with a file called "img_synthetic_gt.csv" that specify the correct coordinates of the segments in the images.

- "src" folder:
    - contains the c++ code of the program

- "python" folder: 
    - Python code for images conversion.
    - Python code to generate synthetic datasets. 
    - Python code to generate test cases.

- "docs" folder: documents, slides and other material related to project.

- "performance" folder:
    - Python Notebook to analyze the performance (not devoloped on HPC Cluster)
    - contains .csv files with the registered performance of each run of the program.

- "output" folder: used to save any output of the program (except the performance)

- "HoughTransform" file: program.
- "parameters" file: parameters to control the program behaviour without rebuilding it.
- "parameters_configurations" : contains different versions of the parameters file.

# Compilation Instructions

The source code is located in the `src/` directory. Before compiling, load the required modules:

```bash
module load gcc91
module load openmpi-3.0.0--gcc-9.1.0
module load mpich-3.2.1--gcc-9.1.0
```

Compile the program using:

```bash
mpic++ -g -Wall -fopenmp -o HoughTransform main.cpp src/*.cpp
```

# Execution

```bash
qsub HoughTransform.sh
```

## Note
In script HoughTransform.sh, to run the program is used the following command:
mpiexec -np $NP_VALUE ./HPC/HoughTransform $PARAM_FILE

# Image converter
## How to use - Local Usage Guide

**Script location:** `python/image_converter.py`

This utility allows converting a single image or all images in a folder to a different format.

### Usage

```bash
python image_converter.py <path_to_image_or_folder> <target_format>
```

### Important
- <path_to_image> must end with the image file name WITHOUT the EXTENSION
- <path_to_folder> must end with the folder name WITHOUT FINAL "/"
- <requested_format> WITHOUT "." in front

EXAMPLE - Convert all images in "input_images" folder to .pnm format

```bash
python image_converter.py dataset/images pnm
```

(python or python3)

## How to use - HPC cluster
CODE IN: python/image_converter.py

1. Create python virtual environment with OpenCV on login node home directory
(from PBS command line inteface slides)

```bash
module load python-3.7.2
python3 -m venv cv2
source cv2/bin/activate
(tf) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
(tf) $ python -m pip install opencv-python
(tf) deactivate
```

Now the environment with openCV is available to encapsulate script execution.

2. Use image_converter.sh script. 
The path and format can be modified in image_converter.sh script.

```bash
qsub image_converter.sh
```
# Synthetic images generator

## How to use - Locally

CODE IN: python/generate_synthetic_images.py

A synthetic image can be generated based on given parameters, which are:
- resolution of the image
- length and number of straight lines

It's possibile to generate more than one image at a time and for each generated image the ground truth data are
also generated and stored. 
All these parameters can be adjusted in script file (see CODE IN).

How to use:

1. Set the parameters inside generate_synthetic_images.py 

2. Use:
```bash
python generate_synthetic_images.py
```

(python or python3)

## How to use - HPC Cluster
CODE IN: python/generate_synthetic_images.py

0. Follow step 1 of: "Image converter - How to use - HPC cluster" section

1. Create python virtual environment with OpenCV on login node home directory (from PBS command line inteface slides)

```bash
module load python-3.7.2
python3 -m venv cv2
source cv2/bin/activate
(tf) $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
(tf) $ python -m pip install opencv-python
(tf) deactivate
```

Now the environment with openCV is available to encapsulate script execution.

2. Set the dataset parameters inside generate_synthetic_images.py file.

3. Generate the dataset using generate_synthetic_images.sh script.

```bash
qsub generate_synthetic_images.sh
```

# Parameters

[Parameters](parameters) is the configuration file for the program.
It contains different properties that allow to control different aspects of the program.
A single executable can be runned more times with totally different parameters.

[Parameters configurations file](parameters_configurations) contains a version of the parameters file for all images in "dataset/".
The parameters specified regard only a subset of them, the ones that influece the preprocessing, HT and clustering operations quality.

## Example:
